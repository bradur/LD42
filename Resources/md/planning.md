# Theme: Running out of space

## Slime is covering the world

 - Blow up / mine the slime before it fills the level / traps you in
 - Get $ from slime destroyed (bonus for speed, minus for area slime covered?)
 - Shop between levels:
    - Running speed
    - Mining speed
    - Explosives
    - etc
 - Concentrated slime:
    - When slime encounters it, a large area turns into slime
    - Can be blown up before slime encounters it
